If you are doing web development for Internet Explorer, then have a look at this [toolbar from Microsoft][1].

It provides all sorts of useful features: it&#8217;ll validate the HTML, show the sizes of images, where tables and cells and DIVs are, allow you to see the DOM and all sorts of other useful bits and pieces.

(Thanks to PCPro magazine for that tip! [www.pcpro.co.uk][2])
