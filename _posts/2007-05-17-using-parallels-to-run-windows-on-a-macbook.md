I haven&#8217;t added anything to the blog for a few months as I&#8217;ve been busy on a number of fronts. First I&#8217;ve swapped over to using a MacBook for day-to-day development. It took me a while to get used to, especially as the keyboard layout in the UK is different from the PC&#8211;and it took me a while to discover that that # is produced using ALT-3 and isn&#8217;t even shown on the keyboard. But I love it! It works really well.

I use IntelliJ and Eclipse for development with Firefox for Java, PHP and Web development so it&#8217;s not much different. MS Office 2004 for the Mac is very different from Office 2003 for the PC, but all works as expected (though there&#8217;s no plug-in for the docx format yet). It&#8217;s very nice having Unix under the hood too.

However, there are a couple of things I still need a PC for, and the most important of those is running Internet Explorer so that I can test web pages. I have other PCs lying around, so I could use those, but the solution I&#8217;ve gone for is to use Parallels ([www.parallels.com][1]). This allows you to run a Windows virtual machine (and Unix if you like) at the same time as MacOS. So I have MacOS for development and then Windows in a window. Windows has access to the DVD drive and internet and behaves just like the real thing&#8211;well it is the real thing (you do need a Windows operating system license to install it). So I can run Internet Explorer and any other PC-only tools on my Mac whenever I need them.
