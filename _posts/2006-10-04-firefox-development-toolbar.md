A friend recently pointed me to a useful development toolbar for Firefox. It&#8217;s similar to the development toolbar [here][1] but does even more stuff.

You can find the toolbar at <http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/>.

Definitely worth having if you&#8217;re working with Firefox (in fact I often use Firefox for debugging Javascript and the like because it tends to be much more helpful than IE!).
