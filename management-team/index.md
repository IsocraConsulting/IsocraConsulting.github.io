<a href="http://46.183.11.70/about-us/management-team/deniss-face-only/" rel="attachment wp-att-210"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-210 alignleft" alt="denis's face only" src="http://46.183.11.70/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/deniss-face-only-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Denis has worked in web and IT positions for more than 25 years. His technical experience has been varied including artificial intelligence, knowledge-based systems, rule induction and building an early prototype of a connected on-line system serving video, travel, shops and banking into the home for Ameritech in Chicago in 1992â€”before the first web browsers were widely available.

Denis now divides his time between management, consulting and Agile and web project management training.
